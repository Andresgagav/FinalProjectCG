Video Game Description:
Level 1: Next I will explain the functionality of level 1, in this level first we have to get our weapon to be able to get to the next level, 
second we must move the boxes and put them together in the form of stairs to be able to use them to jump and this move to level 2:
- In the first case we show how to take the hero's life and observe how the game restarts.
- In the second case, we will advance to the next level without getting the weapon to confirm that we can not pass to the next level.
- In the third case we will play to win in the video game.

Level 2 or Level Final : In this level 2 or final level we must get the weapon again as in the level 1 to be able to kill the boss that has 10 lives, 
this boss also has a maximum of 4 machines that chase the hero. There are two case, the first case is when the boss kills me and it returns me to level 1, 
and the second case is when I kill the boss and ends the game.
